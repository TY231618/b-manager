Makers Academy Week 4: Bookmark Manager Challenge
=========================

User Stories (my interpretation):
```
As a User
So I can keep track of all my bookmarks
I would like to see a list of links

As a User
So that I can update my bookmarks
I would like to be able to add links

As a User
So that I can categorize my links quicker
I would like to be able to add tags to my links

As a User
So that I can browse through my links faster
I would like to filter my links by their tags
```

User Stories (solution):

```
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of links on the homepage

As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly find web sites I recently bookmarked
I would like to see links in descending chronological order

As a time-pressed user
So that I can save a website
I would like to add the site's address and title to my bookmark manager

As a time-pressed user
So that I can organise my many links into different categories for ease of search
I would like to add tags to the links in my bookmark manager

As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly find links on a particular topic
I would like to filter links by tag
```
